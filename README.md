## Matt Firmston

I am a energetic and passionate student looking to become a Full Stack Junior Developer. I am very versatile as I get excited about both creative and technical aspects of development. I am currently studying at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), due to finish in September.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

While working at Hamleys as a toy expert I was expected to know everything there was to know about a given range. Often times new products or even whole ranges of toys would come in with next to no warning, and it was up to me as expert to train other staff on these products that I knew nothing about myself. I would have to research these products quickly, sometimes going as far as to contact the people who developed these products in order to be up to speed with their functionality, recommend age groups, whether they aid child development, etc. Doing this meant that Hamleys kept its reputation as the greatest toy shop in world.

#### Problem solving

I problem solve every day; In part because I believe it keeps my mind active and therefore healthy, but also simply because I enjoy it! I am a big fan of puzzles such as:
- mechanical puzzles - my favourites are rubiks cubes, and the Huzzle cast range
- logic puzzles - I do nonograms daily and also I love codewars (visit [my profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/YoFirmy) to see my progress so far.)
- creative puzzles -  I enjoy playing cssbattle (check out [my profile](https://cssbattle.dev/player/yofirmy) for that too.)

#### Adaptable

As a manager of Oddballs, a small store in a very busy prime location in Camden, I had to be very good at adapting to the situation. A lot of the time (particularly during peak summer and christmas periods) the store would be extremely busy and there would be a huge amount of tasks that required being completed. I would have to be very good at keeping the shop well staffed (and keeping those staff well trained) in order to delegate tasks. During periods that weren't so busy however (during a lot of periods over the pandemic for example) I would have to strip things right back; I would have to furlough staff and tackle more tasks myself rather than delegating, I would have to prioritize my time efficiently so as to not loose the few customers we had but still get everything that was essential for the shop to function completed in time. I have become very good at working both as part of a team and independantly because of these experiences.

## Hobbies

#### Skateboarding
Skateboarding has taught me resilience. In order to learn new tricks I constantly have to put myself at risk of injury, and therefore, further outside of my comfort zone. Although skateboarding is a very physical activity, it's biggest challenge is a mental one: Battling with fear, which helps me to better myself in all aspects of life.

#### Circus
I love learning new skills. My favorite circus skill is passing clubs; Learning to juggle as a pair (or even a group). It's always fun sharing new tricks and ideas, and there seems like no limit to the possibilities.
